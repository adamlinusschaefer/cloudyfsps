# cloudy_lines.dat
# Referenced in cloudy_input.py
# Written in each Cloudy input file to tell the
# program which emission line fluxes to record.
# Format is Cloudy specific -- H  1 1215.68A
# element symbol // transition // wavelength
# NOT wavelength ordered.

# shell_lambda.dat
# Referenced in cloudy_input.py
# Used in shell script mk_linefile.sh
# it is in the same order as cloudy_lines.dat, but gives
# the wavelength of each line in an easy-to-parse
# format and consistent units.

# ordered_lambda.dat
# Referenced in write_out.py
# this is the ordered list of recorded emission lines
# in angstroms.
