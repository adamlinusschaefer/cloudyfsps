## Using cloudyFSPS

* Generate and format FSPS models and compile them for use as ionizing sources (Stellar SED grids) within Cloudy.

* Generate Cloudy input files, either single-parameter or grids of parameters.

* Run Cloudy models using basic shell script or format runs for clustered computing.

* Format Cloudy output files into nice units for explorative manipulation and plotting within python.

* Format Cloudy output for use within FSPS.
  
* Pre-packaged plots for BPT diagram (NII, SII, OI, OII) with observed
  data from HII regions (van Zee+1998) and SDSS galaxies (DR7,
  generated using astroML). Comparisons with MAPPINGSIII models from
  Dopita+2013.

### Prerequisites
cloudyFSPS relies on the use of the following packages:

Cloudy (http://www.nublado.org/)  
FSPS (https://github.com/cconroy20/fsps)  
python-fsps (https://github.com/dfm/python-fsps)  

You must have the following system variables set: 
`$SPS_HOME`, `$CLOUDY_EXE`, `$CLOUDY_DATA_PATH`

### Command line installation
```
git clone https://github.com/nell-byler/cloudyfsps.git 
cd cloudyfsps 
python setup.py install 
```
## Using the precomputed tables of FSPS stellar SEDs within Cloudy

I have generated Flexible Stellar Population Synthesis stellar SEDs for anyone to use within Cloudy:

These can be compiled just like any other stellar SED grid:
